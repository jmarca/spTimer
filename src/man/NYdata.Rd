\title{Observations of ozone concentration levels, maximum temperature and wind speed.}
\description{
       This data set contains values of daily 
	 8-hour maximum average ozone concentrations (parts per billion (ppb)),
	 maximum  temperature (in degree Celsius),
	 wind speed (knots), and 
	 relative humidity, 
	 obtained from 28 monitoring sites of New York, USA.

NYgrid: This dataset contains total 6200 rows for 62 days of observations for 10x10 = 100 grid points.

%We need a publication reference here, for example Sahu and Bakar (2011). Why are the data simulated? Can you explain which fields were simulated and which were kriged? Why don't you take the actual observations? We need see also NYsite.
