	* Version 3.0-0
	* Added truncated/censored (only left-sided) Gaussian approach for GP and GPP models with spatial and temporal predictions.
	* Created an option that will return the fitted values and sd on the original scale. Use fitted.values="ORIGINAL" to get it.
    * Added more flexibility for chosing hyper-parameters of the prior distributions for each coefficients of the model.
